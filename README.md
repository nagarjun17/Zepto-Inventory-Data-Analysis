📈 Key Insights

Some example business insights derived:

Certain categories attract higher discounts but do not always convert to better ratings.

Out-of-stock patterns indicate which product categories need stronger inventory buffering.

Price variability is highest in Beverages and Snacks, showing aggressive discount strategies.

Highly rated items are not always the most discounted, indicating value-driven buying behavior.

Some categories consistently produce higher revenue per item.# Zepto-Inventory-Data-Analysis
